How can I tell Ubuntu to do nothing when I close my laptop lid?
To disable Ubuntu doing anything closing the laptop lid:

Open the /etc/systemd/logind.conf file in a text editor as root, for example,

 sudo -H gedit /etc/systemd/logind.conf
If HandleLidSwitch is not set to ignore then change it:

 HandleLidSwitch=ignore
Make sure it's not commented out (it is commented out if it is preceded by the symbol #) or add it if it is missing.

Restart the systemd daemon (be aware that this will log you off) with this command:

sudo systemctl restart systemd-logind
or, from 15.04 onwards:

sudo service systemd-logind restart
